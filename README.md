# 2017CoreGui
 2017 Core GUI for roblox, requires a level 7 executor with HttpGet.

## Disclaimer
I plan to add measures to bypass detections as i want this script to be undetectable. It's fucking stupid you can get banned for using a script that literally changes the roblox gui that isnt even a fucking cheat.
Sooooooo, we're eventually going to be using hookmetamethod and maybe even hookfunction to bypass that, so basic UNC will be needed eventually!!!!
